Matrix typology of provisions that comprise CSO regulatory regimes. The number in parentheses represents the number of times a provision was discussed by scholars in a review of twenty-one studies analyzing CSO regulatory regimes (1996-2018). Each provision is written as an institutional statement following the ADICO syntax provided by Crawford and Ostrom (2005). The essential components of the syntax are identiﬁed using brackets: [ATTRIBUTES] identify to whom the statement applies, with the default assumption being all members of the group; [DEONTIC] identiﬁes the expectation of behavior identiﬁed by the qualiﬁers ‘may’ (permitted), ‘must’ (obliged), and ‘must not’ (forbidden); [AIM] speciﬁes the particular action or outcome prescribed, or those actions or outcomes that are forbidden; [CONDITIONS] explains when and where the institutional applies with the default assumption being all times and all places; [OR ELSE] assigns consequences for noncompliance. The familiar example requiring American men to register for Selective Service can be written as an institutional statement thusly: [All male U.S. citizens between the ages of 18 and 25] [must] [register for Selective Service within 30 days of their 18-birthday using one of the methods prescribed by the Selective Service System] [at all times and in all places unless they are exempted] [or else face imprisonment, a ﬁne, or both].
